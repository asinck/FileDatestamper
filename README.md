# File Datestamper

This is an android application that generates datestamps for your file.

Note, you must "Sync Project with Gradle Files" with the ![sync-project](screenshots/sync-project.png) button when you pull this repo.

For an input of `New File 1`, example datestamp output would be `New_File_1_2017_07_03.txt`, and example timestamp output would be `New_File_1_2017_07_03_18-06.txt`. The timestamp uses 24-hr time. The output is editable, and can be copied to the clipboard with the button.

This is what the program looks like.
